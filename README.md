# Create-Image-Classifier-with-Deep-Learning
### Project Description:
Train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. The convert it into a command line application.
### Files:
- Image Classifier Project.ipynb:  
  A Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with PyTorch.
- train.py:  
  Train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint.
- predict.py:  
  Uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.
- cat_to_name.json:  
  A dictionary mapping the integer encoded categories to the actual names of the flowers.
### Dataset:
The dataset can be download from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).
